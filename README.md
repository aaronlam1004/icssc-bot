# ICSSC Bot

ICSSC Bot was made using [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/#/) for the ICSSC Discord Server.

## Running

Prior to running the bot, you need to do the [basic setup](https://www.sitepoint.com/discord-bot-node-js/)

In the project directory, you can install the dependencies using:
### ``npm install```

Then change **line 252** in **bot.js** to:

```js
bot.login("YOUR CLIENT TOKEN HERE");
```

And then run the bot using:
### ```npm start```
